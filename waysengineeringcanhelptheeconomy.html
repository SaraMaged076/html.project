<h4>Engineering Ways can help the economy </h4>
Every time there’s a crisis or a major problem, there are opportunities that lead to improvements. For example, there will be more people with ideas about how to distribute things — leading to more Amazon-like companies. There will be innovations in rapid diagnostics; the Holy Grail is a home test for COVID-19. There will be new platforms — I don’t think Zoom is the end; there will be competitors. These will all produce jobs. We’re also learning more about education, so you’ll see more companies emerging around home schooling and education.
Much of the economy will come back in information technology and manufacturing — and then in the service industry, because you’ll need to service all of these things. I actually think COVID will lead to more economic development once we control it.
